# Tests 
Separate xUnit test project for the event feed application. 
Uses Moq and dependency injection to unit test services.

> I would add many more tests for a real application. I believe in code coverage and really value testing.

## Install
Make the application project with `make build` in that directory.

## Run

`make test`
